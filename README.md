## Weather app
Using [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/), I built an app that, on choice, can be set as following.

#### 1. What's the weather like in Kuala Lumpur?
By inputing the name of a place, it gives the weather as result;
    
#### 2. Add Select2 package from NPM
With a easy jQuery dropdown listing all the city in the world - the search field is helped with an autocomplete feature;

#### 3. Get current location
By pressing a button, it will browse the **current location** with [`getCurrentPosition()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation/getCurrentPosition) and returns the local weather.
